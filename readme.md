# AtheistDisco

Play [satoshiDICE](http://satoshidice.com/) with a [Blockchain Wallet](https://blockchain.info/wallet/).

## Install

You need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) with [npm](http://npmjs.org).

Navigate your shell to this folder and type `npm install` to install required modules.

## Configure

Rename `config.dist.js` to `config.js` and fill in your Blockchain Wallet credentials.

## Run

Dry run without actual playing:

````
node ./atheistdisco.js --dry
````

No kidding:

````
node ./atheistdisco.js
````

## How does it work?

Simple. The script keeps doubling the stake till it wins or everything is lost.

## Why is it called "AtheistDisco"

Because i like anagrams.
